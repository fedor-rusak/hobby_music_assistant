You play guitar or piano for fun? Like trying to playalong with your favorite songs or doodle something from your imagination? Ever tried to use some musical theory to guide you but got stuck with all the terms and names and plain old WTF are they talking about?

This project is an attempt to simplify music theory for hobby musicians. Gradual theory introduction with some examples and maybe some future assistant for your own musical discoveries.

Free (as in Freedom) to use and extend!
